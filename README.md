# PricePrediction

The project is a price prediction project for houses in New York City (NYC). The objective of the project encompasses data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. In this regard, various machine learning models, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, were employed.

Among these models, Logistic Regression exhibited the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) value, indicating superior predictive performance compared to the other models. The MSE serves as an evaluation metric that quantifies the average squared difference between the predicted and actual price values. The lower the MSE, the closer the predicted prices align with the true prices, suggesting higher accuracy in price predictions.

The aforementioned findings highlight the suitability of Logistic Regression for the price prediction task in the context of NYC houses, based on the evaluation of the MSE metric.
